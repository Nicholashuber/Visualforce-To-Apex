# Visualforce-To-Apex

This code shows how to pass input values from visualforce to apex.

In the example below inside an <apex:form> tag I am using the input field {!myInputQueryString} to pass the value typed in when the command button is clicked. This will invoke the controller and re render the output input text field with the value you passed in.
